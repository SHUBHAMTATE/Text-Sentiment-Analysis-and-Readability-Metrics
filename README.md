Automate key factor calculations.

Generate a standardized “2-pager” summary (facts & figures) for each wave.

Data Intake & Cleansing

Ingest fresh data from both CAPI and CATI.

Run Python/SQL routines to:

Clean, dedupe, and normalize records.

Append cleaned data into your master template each morning.

Sampling-Related Analysis

Produce variation reports by demographics (caste, gender, etc.) to guide field teams on sampling quotas.

Highlight emerging trends in MLA/MP performance and shifts in public opinion.

Operational Automation

Leverage Python scripts to automate repetitive tasks (e.g., template population, QC checks) so operations run smoothly and error-free.

3. Key Tools & Expertise
Excel & Advanced Formulas (template design, multi-sheet calculations)

Python Scripting (data cleaning, report automation)

SQL Server (data querying & integration)

CAPI & CATI Workflows (survey-platform data pipelines)

Quality Control (audit templates, daily QC summaries)
